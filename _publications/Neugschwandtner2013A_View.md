WebView is a technique to mingle web and native applications for mobile devices. The fact that its main incentive requires making data stored on, as well as the functionality of mobile devices, directly accessible to active web content, is not without consequences to security. In this paper, we present a threat scenario that targets WebView apps and show its practical applicability in a case study of selected apps. We further show results of our examination of over 287,000 apps in regard to WebView-related vulnerabilities.
