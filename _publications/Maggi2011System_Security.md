This paper summarizes the past, present and future lines of research in the systems security area pursued by the Performance Evaluation Lab of Politecnico di Milano. We describe our past research in the area of learning algorithms applied to intrusion detection, our current work in the area of malware analysis, and our future research outlook, oriented to the cloud, to mobile device security, and to cyber-physical systems.
