 I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Giovanni Vigna and Christopher Kruegel in the SecLab at UC Santa Barbara. My research interests focus on several aspects of systems security. Currently, I am actively involved in projects related to automated vulnerability discovery (in firmware blobs and Android applications), and related to human-assisted cyber reasoning systems.

Earned a Ph.D at EURECOM, where I was advised by Davide Balzarotti. Among other things, we investigated how non-atomic acquisitions impact the consistency of memory dumps, and we developed a framework to find new memory forensics heuristics and to assess the quality of existing ones.
